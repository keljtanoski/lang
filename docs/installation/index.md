# Installation

## Install the package

All you need to do to get started is add Laravel Lang to your composer dependencies:

```bash:no-line-numbers
composer require laravel-lang/lang --dev
```

When installing the package this way, you will need to manually copy the files from the `vendor/laravel-lang/lang` folder into your application.

If you want to automate the process, then use one of the [publishers](managers.md).
